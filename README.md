## 🌾 About the Project

FarmService was developed to address a critical challenge faced by our client, a company providing agricultural services. **The problem?** Too much time was being spent on organizing tasks, determining which fields needed work, and scheduling employee time. **Solution?** An efficient, easy-to-use mobile app that takes the hassle out of task management!

**Unique Solution:** This innovative solution, entirely designed and implemented by me from scratch, is a bespoke application tailored to meet the specific needs of our client. This app not only lifts the burden of task and employee management but also significantly reduces errors during work. It's a one-of-a-kind project, a direct response to our client's pressing needs.

**The ideology** driving the creation of FarmService is rooted in simplicity and user-friendliness. The aim is to cater to users of all levels, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with technology can easily navigate the app. Here's how it's implemented:

- **Single-Click Interaction:** Embracing the philosophy of minimal user engagement, FarmService maximizes automation. Processes such as field data management and employee onboarding are streamlined and automated. For instance, adding employees is as simple as scanning a QR code.

- **Automatic Task Recovery:** Even in the event of application restarts, the task currently being performed by an employee is automatically reloaded, ensuring seamless continuity.

- **Automated Data Collection:** Location data of employees during work sessions is automatically gathered, facilitating better monitoring and control.

This approach ensures that FarmService is not only efficient but also intuitive, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

### FarmService consists of two main parts:
1. **Employee Section**
2. **Owner Section**

### 👩‍🌾 Employee Section

This part of the app is designed for field workers to easily view and manage their tasks. Features include:
- **Task List**: Displays the tasks assigned to the employee.
- **Navigation**: Provides location of the field where the work needs to be done, including a map showing both the field locations and the current location of the employee.
- **Real-time Geolocation**: Offers geolocational information such as current speed of the employee, ensuring efficient movement between tasks.
- **Session Management**: Tracks and displays information about current work sessions, allowing for better time management.
- **Work Time**: Provides employees with the current time spent on work tasks, aiding in time tracking and project management.
- **Automatic Task Recovery**: Ensures that the screen with the open task is automatically reloaded, even if the application reloads for any reason, ensuring seamless continuity in task management. 
- **Status Updates**: Allows employees to update the status of their tasks in real-time.

### 👨‍💼 Owner Section

This part of the app is designed for the company owner. It is divided into four main sections:
1. **Activities**: View current activities of employees, allowing the owner to monitor work being performed in real-time and directly oversee the actions being taken by employees.
2. **Machines**: Manage and track all agricultural machinery, ensuring optimal usage and maintenance.
3. **Employees**: Oversee and organize employee details, assignments, and schedules. The owner can add new employees through a very interesting, user-friendly, and easy-to-use process. Specifically, the owner uses a QR code generated for the employee. The employee logs into the app as an employee and displays their QR code. The employer simply scans this QR code, automatically adding the employee with all their details, greatly simplifying and speeding up the process of adding new employees. Additionally, the employer can edit employee details and manage their current status, which affects their ability to perform tasks.
4. **Clients**: Manage clients and their fields effectively. Utilizing client data, the owner automatically populates all client information and creates them in the system. The owner can then manage these clients, edit their details, and add information about their company, as our service company's clients may also include other businesses.

In these sections, the owner has the ability to:
- **Task Management**: Create, assign, and manage tasks for employees.
- **Employee Scheduling**: Organize employee schedules to maximize efficiency.
- **Field Overview**: Get a comprehensive view of all fields and their current status.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track the progress of tasks and employee locations in real-time.
- **Resource Allocation**: Manage the allocation of equipment and resources to various tasks.
- **Client Management**: Automatically populate client information and manage client details, including editing and adding company information for service company clients.

## 📲 **Features**

- **Employee Scheduling**: Organizes employee schedules to maximize efficiency and minimize downtime.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides real-time updates on task progress and employee locations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design that makes it easy for everyone to use, from managers to field workers.
- **Google Account Integration**: Enables seamless login and account creation through Google, streamlining the onboarding process.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Utilizes haptic feedback and sound effects to provide a more immersive and enjoyable experience for users, enhancing their interaction with the application.
- **Minimal User Engagement**: Embraces the ideology of single-click interaction, aiming for maximum reduction in user effort while ensuring optimal task management and efficiency.
